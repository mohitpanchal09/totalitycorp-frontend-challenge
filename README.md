Welcome to my submission for the Totality Corp Frontend Developer Assignment. In this project, I have developed an intermediate-level e-commerce website using React, following the provided guidelines.

## Features Implemented

- **Product Listing:** 
  - Display a variety of products with images, names, prices, and "Add to Cart" buttons.
  - Implemented filters to allow users to sort products by category, price range, or ratings.

- **Shopping Cart:** 
  - Implemented a cart section to display the added products, quantities, and total cost.
  - Remove items from the cart.
  - Display real-time updates of the cart total and item count.

- **Checkout:** 
  - Implemented a checkout process that calculates the total cost of items in the cart.
  - Allow users to make payments for their purchases.

- **Payment Gateway Integration with Stripe:**
  - Integrated the Stripe payment gateway to facilitate secure online payments.
  - Users can make payments for their orders using credit/debit cards.

- **Responsive Design:** 
  - Ensured the website is responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
  - Optimized the layout for different screen sizes.

- **User Authentication (Optional):** 
  - Provided user registration and login functionalities.
  - Display the user's name and avatar when logged in.

## Tech Stack Used

- React
- Redux for state management
- MongoDb for database
- Stripe for payment gateway integration
  
## State Management with Redux

- **Redux**: 
  - I have implemented state management using Redux to efficiently manage the application's global state.
  - Redux helps in managing complex application states, such as user authentication, shopping cart data.

### User Authentication and JWT Token

- **User Authentication**: 
  - I have integrated user authentication features into the project.
  - Users can register and log in to access personalized features.
  
- **JWT Token**: 
  - Upon successful authentication, the user receives a JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure and stateless authentication.
  - The JWT token is stored in the browser's local storage for persistence across sessions.
  - Security measures have been taken to ensure sensitive data is securely stored and managed.

## Local Storage

- **Local Storage**: 
  - Browser's local storage is utilized to store the JWT token and user details.
  - Storing the token locally allows for seamless user authentication on subsequent visits.
  - Security measures have been taken to ensure the safety of sensitive user data.

## Data Flow

- **Data Flow with Redux**:
  - I have provided a clear and structured data flow within the application using Redux.
  - Actions and reducers handle user authentication, shopping cart updates, and payment processing.
